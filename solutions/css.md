### 1) What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS?

ID selectors are more specific than class selectors, so it takes precedence on applying styles to an element.

### 2) What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?

Resets aim to **remove** all built-in browser styling.

Normalizers aim to make all built-in browser styling **consistent** across browsers.

If you would like to implement your own styles for every element from the ground up, including tests and bug fixes, a reset is the way to go.

On the other hand, if you want to begin from a foundation, with inconsistencies across browsers _normalized_, normalizers to the rescue!

I prefer the last.

### 3) Describe Floats and how they work.

Float is a CSS positioning property. The element it's applied to is taken from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow, contrary to absolute positioning.

### 4) Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.

The `z-index` property controls the stacking of elements that overlap.

Stacking context is the three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage.

A stacking context is formed, anywhere in the document, by any element which is either

- the root element (HTML),
- positioned (absolutely or relatively) with a `z-index` value other than "auto",
- a flex item with a `z-index` value other than "auto",that is the parent element `display: flex|inline-flex`,
- elements with an `opacity` value less than 1,
- elements with a `transform` value other than "none",
- elements with a `mix-blend-mode` value other than "normal",
- elements with a `filter` value other than "none",
- elements with a `perspective` value other than "none",
- elements with `isolation` set to "isolate",
- position: fixed
- specifying any attribute above in `will-change` even if you don't specify values for these attributes directly
- elements with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling` set to "touch"

### 5) Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.

A Block Formatting Context is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out, that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:

- The value of `float` is not `none`
- The value of `position` is neither `static` nor `relative`
- The value of `display` is `table-cell`, `table-caption`, `inline-block`, `flex`, or `inline-flex`
- The value of `overflow` is not `visible`.

In a block formatting context, each box’s left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch). This is true even in the presence of floats (although a box’s line boxes may shrink due to the floats), unless the box establishes a new block formatting context (in which case the box itself may become narrower due to the floats).

### Explain the difference between `visibility:hidden` and `display:none`

`visibility: hidden` makes the element invisible, but the element still occupies space in the layout (that is, it's rendered as an empty box), whereas the latter (`display: none`) removes the element entirely from the render tree such that the element is invisible and is not part of the layout.
